- Obesity: > 30 BMI
- Overweight: 25 > BMI > 30
- Diabetes
  - Type 1: Pancreas doesn't make Insulin
  - Type 2: Diabetes Mellitus: Cells don't respond to Insulin
- Blood Lipids -- fats -- doesn't disolve in blood on their own -- need lipoproteins
  - Cholesterol -- build cell membranes, harmones, vitamin D, bile acids (help digest fat) -- carried by lipoproteins
    - lipoproteins -- transport system
      - Low Density Lipoproteins LDL -- bad cholesterol (from liver to cells) -- can result in built up cholesterol in heart artery walls -- heart attack!
      - High Density Lipoprotein HDL -- good cholesterol (from cells to liver)
  - Triglycerides -- energy storage
- Sedentary -- little or no physical activity

## Coursera: Science of Diet and Exercise

### NASM Metabolic Makeover

- Metabolism -- biochemical reactions that keep us alive
- TEE Total Energy Expenditure
- TDEE Total Daily Energy Expenditure
- RMR Resting Metabolic Rate -- 60-75%
- BMR Basic Metabolic Rate
- TEF Thermic Effect of Food -- 10% of TEE -- food storing, swallowing, digesting, ...
- TEPA Thermic Effect of Physical Activity
- NEAT NonExercise Activity Thermogenesis


<br/><br/>

- Oxygen Kinetics -- Indirect Calorimetry -- Amount of Oxygen consumed, carbon dioxide expelled. 
- Lean Body Mass = Body Weight - Fat Weight
- RMR
  - Harris and Benedict
  - Mifflin St Jeor
  - Cunningham
  - Katch-McArdle
- AF Activity Factor
  - SAF Standard Activity Factor
  - WAF Weighted Activity Factor
- MET Metabolic Equivalent of Task
  - 1 MET = 3.5mL of oxygen per kg per minute
  - 1L oxygen consumed = 5kcal expended
- Metabolic Profiling
  - Time Based approach -- time for each activity group (sitting, sleeping, ...)
  - Points Based approach -- 
- Fixed Components -- RMR
- Dynamic Components -- NEAT


<br/><br/>

- More time seated, sedentary = more reductions in HDL and Lipoprotein Lipase LPL -- increased cardiovascular disease
  - in non-active promotes uptake in fat cells within visceral fat in abdominal region
  - in active promotes uptake in fatty acids into muscle cells
- Building lean body mass can help -- protein synthesis and breakdown costs energy
- EPOC Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption 
  - Influenced by intensity and duration
- HIIT High Intensity Interval Training
- Macronutrients -- required in large amounts to supply energy -- protein, carb, fat
- Hunger -- biological response to replenish energy reserves -- low sugar, growling stomach, ... -- physiological event
- Appetite -- desire or interest -- psychological event
- Sleep -- less than 6 hours -- increased stress and cortisol levels
- Fluid Intake -- say cold water intake, energy is needed to bring it to body temperature

### Science of Fat Metabolism

- lipids -- soluable in non polar solvents
- fats -- sterols, free fatty acids FFAs, triglycerides, phospholipids
  - triglycerides, FFAs, Cholesterol
  - hydrocarbons -- H, C, O
- Triglycerides -- major fat, 3 fatty acids (long carbon chains) joined together -- simple fats
  - Simple fats, 95-98%
- compound fats -- lipoproteins like HDL - transport fats in blood, phospholipids in cell membranes
- derived fats -- cholesterol forming harmones, fat-soluable vitamins
- compound + derived -- 2 to 5 %
- fats
  - reegulate temperature -- cold protection
  - produce harmones
  - immunity and inflammatory responses
  - create blood vessels
  - transportation
  - nerve conduction -- functional roles
  - apetite and hunger
- fat digestion and absorption
  - begins in salivary glands
  - bile -- alkaline fluid -- secreted by liver, stored in gallbladder, mixed in small intestine
  - lipase -- digestive enzyme -- minor breakdown of fat molecules -- triglicerydes with short chain fatty acids -- released by pancreas
  - short and medium chained fatty acids entire blood and are absorbed
  - long chain FAs are insoluable, recombined into triglycerides 
  - cholesterol -- lipid like waxy substance. 
  - chylomicron -- largest transport protein -- travels through lymphatic system -- thoratic duct --> subclavian veins -- located under collarbone
  - lipoprotein lipase LPL -- breaks Chylomicron (water-lovign; hydrophilic) into glycerol and fatty acids
  - Adipocytes -- cells specialized in storing fat that make up adipose tissue -- triglycerides in muscles
  - Tissues -- don't have mitochondria and cannot use fat as fuel
  - So, these chylomicrons are now transported to liver
- LDL, HDL, Cholesterol
  - Chylomicrons are recycled into lipoproteins, bile, triglycerides
  - VLDLs Very Low Density Lipoproteins
  - LDL Low Density Lipoprotein -- more protein, less fat -- carries cholesterol from liver to cells -- bad cholesterol
    - LDL I - large size
    - LDL II - medium size
    - LDL III - small size
  - HDL High Density Lipoprotein -- carries cholesterol from cells to liver -- Good Cholesterol

- Average person has about 100,000 calories stored for future use. 
- About 7500 to 12000 grams in subcutaneous tissue -- under skin -- adipose tissue & visceral tissue (around organs)
  - Visceral layer -- abdominal region -- dangerous -- greater levels of insulin resistance
    - releases inflammatory compounds
  - Subcutaneous layer -- under skin 
- About 150 to 300 grams in muscle cells
- About 5 grams in blood as plasma 
- Men waist circumference cutoff -- 40inches -- 100cm
- lipolysis -- process of breaking down stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and FFAs
-
