Everything starts with Integrity. We need to be honest. People trust us. Be a caretaker. 

Character is built by integrity. The way you act when nobody's looking. Anybody can put on a show. But how do you act when no one's looking?

Loyalty to the people, organization, what we stand for. 

Pride -- ownership, my tools, my organization, my people. 


<br/><br/>

Not a job. Calling. Asks everything you have and then some. 
Pride (Craftmanship of servcie), Honor (Weight of the badge), Integrity (Moral compass when it's hot and dark). These are actions, decisions you make. 

Pride is not arrogance (thinking you're better than others.) It is knowing you are part of something bigger and holding yourself to highest standards. Appearance is the first promise you make to someone. You will make sure everything works every single day. You will never know everything. You train relentlessly. First one to volunteer and last one to leave. Ask quesitons. Take pride in being a master of your craft. 

Pride is internal drive to be excellent because the job demands it and the people we serve deserves it. 

Honor is about reputation. Legacy. Trust is gained throug sacrifice, bravery, and service. Honor is what stops you from cutting corners. What makes you do the right thing when it's the hard thing. Treating everyone with dignity and respect. 

Integrity is who you are when nobody's watching. Owning your mistakes. Bedrock of the gut feeling. Internal compass pointing towards right, ethical, and just decision, even when scared, exhausted, and running on pure adrenaline. Without which you are a liability. 

Be the calm in the storm. Solve. Be force of order. Bring tools, training, clear head. 

Make their worst day a little better. Show compassion. Be kind. 

Stand in the Gap. Be the physical barrier. Living shield. Most run from danger, we signed up to run towards it.
