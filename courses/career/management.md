## Six Sigma Online: White Belt

3$\sigma$ -- 93.32% 
4$\sigma$ -- 99.4%
5$\sigma$ -- 99.97% -- 233 defects per million
6$\sigma$ -- 99.9997% -- 3.4 defects per million

process improvement methodology 

variation in process -- opportunities for error -- product defects -- poor custoemr satisfaction

reduce process costs

strategies based on measurement and metrics
data driven processes and decisions


Beta testing
Implementing new idea, system, or product with a select group. reduce risks and costs. 

identify problems, validate assumptions, brainstorm solutions, plan for implementation to avoid unintended consequences. 

$\text{Yield} = \frac{\text{No of Opportunities} - \text{No of Defects}}{\text{No of Opportunities}} \times 100$

consider the expense of an improvement

continuous improvement -- consider all options before embarking on most lucrative improvement measures. 

principles
1. customer-focused improvement
   1. VoC Voice of Customer
   2. measurements, statistics, process improvement methods
2. value stream
   1. sequence of items, events, people required to produce end result
   2. areas of concern, waste and improvement. 
3. continuous process improvement
   1. prioritizes areas of opportunity on a continuous basis. 
4. variation
5. removing waste
   1. concept of waste comes from lean process management methodology
6. equipping people
   1. process improvement team -- project management, methodology experts, subject matter experts -- define plan implement improvement
7. controlling the process


challenges
1. lack of support
2. lack of resources or knowledge
3. poor project execution
   1. low risk, high reward improvements
4. data access issues
5. concerns about using six sigma in a specific industry

LSS Lean Six Sigma
- White -- Overview
- Yellow -- DMAIC Define Measure Analyze Improve Control
  - 3-4 weeks; 4 hour in-person;
- Green -- project, process
- Black

<br/><br/>

- Allowing someone to work on something is not same as supporting them
- Product is watching the needle move. 
- Fish Bone, 5 Whys, Sigma Excel, ... tools
- Cooking the books, is not change. 
- Process Owner -- whoever manages the process. 
- DMAIC -- roadmap for every level of project.
- Root cause analysis -- overtime? Not gonna fix something you don't know. 

<br/><br/>

- Ford -- Assembly Line
- Toyota -- Productionized Production Line
  - spits product every 54 seconds?
- Shiner


<br/><br/>

- IT, PD, FD, HR, Waste Maangement, Asset Manggement, Utilities, Water, Municipal, 

<br/><br/>

- Vision and Mission linked to metrics. 
  - Business Score Card (what we are going to focus on)
- Customers and Stakeholders
- Effectiveness and Capability -- These are the problems and these are the possible solutions. 


<br/><br/>

- Connecting People
- Breaking barriers between managers and workers -- work together
- Mentorship -- find replacement; water your flowers


<br/><br/>

House of Lean
- SOP Standard Operating Procedure
- We can't -- root cause
  - No Money
  - No SOP
  - Not enough People
- We can't
  - Policy
  - System
  - Not trained
  - Refuse to
- Position description
- Quality
  - make problems visible -- bring to attention, what can we do to help improve, constructive criticism
  - stop and fix 
  - quality at every step
- JIT Just In Time
  - flow 
  - pull system
  - TAKT time planning
- Highest quality, lowest cost, shortest lead time


<br/><br/>

- You manage processes and not people.
- Value (what customer is willing to pay for) -> Value Stream (Value Added, Value Enabling (no value added, but required), non-value added) -> Flow -> Pull -> Perfection
- What you do affects up-stream and down-stream
- Adopt or die
- Re-engineer to make it error/mistake proof
- Nothing is more important than time
- 3 Ms
  - Muri -- Overburden
  - Mura -- Inconsistency
  - Muda -- Lean 8 Wastes -- TIMSWOOD
    - Transportation
      - one set of equipment for different projects -- drones, camera, 
    - Inventory
      - understaffed to process information
      - fluid inventory, not having enough stock
      - Pull -- pulling the right inventory 
    - Motion
      - over worked and understaffed
    - Waiting
      - bottleneck customers, traffic cannot flow freely
      - categorizing assignments with priority -- chronological; who determines that priority
      - approval process, back and forth
      - waiting for arrival -- acquire, send, 
      - too long on resolution
      - delayed vendor reports
    - Overproduction
    - Over processing
      - buy equipment thats not used -- hardware; 
      - too much verification of the same thing
      - multiple people doing the same job
      - billing water, gas, -- auto processing, exceptions -- check different things;
    - Defects
      - Incorrect paperwork resulting in delay in processing
    - Skills
    - People
- Quantify problem statement -- different from complaint


<br/><br/>

- lean reduces waste
- sigma reduces process variation and defects
- DPMO Defects Per Million Opportunities -- potential for a mistake 
- Measure -- baseline, expectation, accuracy
- Project -- Project Management, Problem Solving, Strategic Alignment
- VOC Voice of Customer
- CTQ Critical to Quality
- VOP Voice of the Process
- VOB Voice of Business


<br/><br/>

Do not have valves on hand
- measurement -- analysis of inventory data
- man -- inventory management
- mother nature -- covid, bad weather
- method -- delivery truck, manfucaturing windows
- materials -- lack of available storage, shortage of materials

Why
- We can not actually analyze inventory
- We did not have adequate inventory metrics
- Gas system growth was always typical
- We were not actually tracking


<br/><br/>

- voice of customer, employees, process -- cycle times, cost, revenue, savings (reallocation), avoidance
- just do it -- fix problems
- lean/kaizen -- DMAIC but quick, like a week. 
- DMAIC
- DMADV
